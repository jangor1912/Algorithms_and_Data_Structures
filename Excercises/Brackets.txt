A bracket sequence is a string containing only characters "(" and ")".

A regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "1" and "+" between the original characters of the sequence. For example, bracket sequences "()()", "(())" are regular (the resulting expressions are: "(1)+(1)", "((1+1)+1)"), and ")(" and "(" are not.

You are given n 
n
 bracket sequences s 1 ,s 2 ,…,s n  
s1,s2,…,sn
. Calculate the number of pairs i,j(1?i,j?n) 
i,j(1?i,j?n)
 such that the bracket sequence s i +s j  
si+sj
 is a regular bracket sequence. Operation + 
+
 means concatenation i.e. "()(" + ")()" = "()()()".

If s i +s j  
si+sj
 and s j +s i  
sj+si
 are regular bracket sequences and i?j 
i?j
, then both pairs (i,j) 
(i,j)
 and (j,i) 
(j,i)
 must be counted in the answer. Also, if s i +s i  
si+si
 is a regular bracket sequence, the pair (i,i) 
(i,i)
 must be counted in the answer.


Input

The first line contains one integer n(1?n?3·10 5 ) 
n(1?n?3·105)
 — the number of bracket sequences. The following n 
n
 lines contain bracket sequences — non-empty strings consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The sum of lengths of all bracket sequences does not exceed 3·10 5  
3·105
.


Output

In the single line print a single integer — the number of pairs i,j(1?i,j?n) 
i,j(1?i,j?n)
 such that the bracket sequence s i +s j  
si+sj
 is a regular bracket sequence.

Note

In the first example, suitable pairs are (3,1) 
(3,1)
 and (2,2) 
(2,2)
.

In the second example, any pair is suitable, namely (1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2) 
(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2)
.
